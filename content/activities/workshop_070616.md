## **a). Event:**

**CRIME, POLICING AND CITIZENSHIP (CPC) PROJECT | CLOSING WORKSHOP, UCL, LONDON, UK**

## **Workshop title:**

***Big Data and Intelligent Policing***

## **Short description:**

In May 2012, UCL began working with the Metropolitan Police Service on a major EPSRC-funded research project on Crime, Policing and Citizenship (CPC). The motivation was to develop new methods and applications in space-time analytics and emergent network complexity. 

Throughout the funding period, CPC has uncovered patterning in crime, policing and citizen perceptions, at a range of spatial and temporal scales. The research team has been avowedly inter-disciplinary, drawing on geoinformatics, crime science, geography and computer science, and the over-arching objective has been to engineer effective solutions to real world crime problems.

This workshop closed the project by presenting the outcomes of the research. It also provided a forum to discuss the role of Big Data in aspects of life that lie beyond intelligent policing. The workshop was used to disseminate the findings across policing, government, industry and academia.

Tools developed for crime prediction and police patrol analysis were demonstrated at the event.
