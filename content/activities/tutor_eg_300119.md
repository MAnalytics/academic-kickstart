## **Title:**

**"Cryptocurrencies, Tor, and the Darkweb - Advances in Technology for Crime"**
  
## **Abstract:**

When it comes to fighting criminal activity on the darkweb, there have been many success stories. Law enforcement agencies from different countries work together to take-down major marketplaces offering illegal and illicit goods. However, these take-downs often only make a small dent in the darkweb operations, and imitators/competitors will quickly rise to take their place. How do sites brazenly operate on the darkweb in a way that is so resistant to interruption? In this talk, I will cover some of the technology used in obscuring the presence of darkweb sites and their users, as well as covering some of the data available for researching modern (and highly technical) crime.
