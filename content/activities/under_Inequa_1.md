## **How socio-economic deprivation drives crime inequality - A case of two cities**

**[Coming soon]**

## **Developing the 'Akmedoids' statistical package and its application to assess long-term inequality in the exposure to crime** ##

**Date**: 15th May, 2019

In recent years we have seen an increasing interest in the study of longitudinal crime concentrations at small geographic scales such as street segments and neighbourhoods. That said, the prospect of being able to adequately identify the slowly changing character of these place-based crime profiles has been hindered by one key methodological drawback: the heightened sensitivity of existing longitudinal clustering methods to short-term fluctuations. Amongst the [**Read More..**](https://www.understanding-inequalities.ac.uk/developing-the-%E2%80%98akmedoids%E2%80%99-statistical-package-and-its-application-to-assess-long-term-inequality-in)


## **The crime drop and neighbourhood inequalities in the exposure to crime: A longitudinal study of violent and property crime in Glasgow and Birmingham (2001-2016)** ##

**Date**: 9th November, 2018

Since the 1990s, a dramatic decline in recorded crime has been observed across many developed polities (Aebi and Linde, 2010; Tseloni et al., 2010). Set against this finding, there has been limited attention paid to the crime drop at the neighbourhood level, an exception being Bannister et al (2017) who found marked distinction in the crime drop trajectories of different neighbourhood groupings in Glasgow. Building upon this finding, this paper seeks to [**Read More..**](https://www.understanding-inequalities.ac.uk/types-of-inequality/the-crime-drop-and-neighbourhood-inequalities-in-the-exposure-to-crime-a)
