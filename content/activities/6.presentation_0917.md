## **f). Event:**

**18TH ECTQG, YORK, UK**

## **Presentation title:**

**"Developing a hybrid hotspot approach for improving the accuracy of crime prediction"**

## **Abstract:**

The ability of different crime hotspot methods to complement each other has been discussed in previous studies. This paper extends the idea of complementarity of the hotspot to develop a hybrid approach in which outputs of multiple methods are combined in order to improve the predictive accuracy. A case study of Chicago crime is presented to demonstrate that a considerable level of accuracy can be gained by using the hybrid hotpot approach.
