# Welcome

Welcome to my website. This website is set to provide an overview of my research, particularly those with further research or real-life practical applications. The [Open-tools](https://www.madepeju.com/#projects) section of this website presents the analytical tools that relate to those research. All the tools are based on R ('open-source') platform, as also the design of this website (see details [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MAnalytics/Teaching/master/Design%20your%20own%20website_Workshop%2030th%20Jan.%202019.pdf)). I hope you find the contents useful.

# About me

I am a 'geoinformatician' by training. Many of my research focus on explaining things from a geographical viewpoint. Nearly all human processes have certain spatial (and temporal) characteristics to them, and there is a lot we can decipher by examining these characteristics. Of particular interest to me is the spatial understanding of criminal behaviours and victimisation, and how we can leverage big data opportunities to answer key criminological questions. Based in [MMU Crime and Well-Being Big Data Centre](https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/crime-and-policing/big-data-centre/), my current research focus on the development of measures of crime inequalities and risk indicators, taking into account the identified drivers and spatial patterns of crime. Prior to joining the [MMU]((https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/crime-and-policing/big-data-centre/)), a part of my research had focussed on developing analytical tools for informing decision-making in a real-life policing environment. Some of my work have influenced police practices and helped to reduce crime levels in some UK cities.
